# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

The key factor of this problem is to determine the begining and the ending of the longest substring. Remeber it is the consecutive substring, keeping a hashmap to store the position of the last occurrence of the element in this time. Cotinuing move the ending position pointer to right until meet an element that has appeared before. Update the longest length and move begining pointer to the right to the repeated element + 1 position, the position have already record in the hashmap (Remeber the begining pointer can only move toward right, so if the position of the repeated element in the left of the begining pointer, the begining pointer just stay in the same place). The time complexity is O(2n) = O(n) because we only consider the begining pointer and the ending pointer, and operate the hash table at most once each time.
